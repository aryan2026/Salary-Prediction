Salary Prediction Model
This repository contains code for building and running a simple salary prediction model using Python and scikit-learn.

Overview
The salary prediction model is built using a linear regression algorithm to predict salaries based on the number of work years. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical salary data.



Feel free to modify the code or dataset to experiment with different features or algorithms.
Make sure to provide a valid dataset with appropriate columns for training the model.
Feel free to customize the README file further based on your specific requirements or additional instructions you want to provide.
