Salary Prediction Model
This repository contains code for building and running a simple salary prediction model using Python and scikit-learn.

Overview
The salary prediction model is built using a linear regression algorithm to predict salaries based on the number of work years. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical salary data.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python (3.6 or higher)
pandas
scikit-learn
Instructions
Follow these steps to write and run the code for salary prediction:

Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/salary-prediction.git
Navigate to the Repository: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository directory:
bash
Copy code
cd salary-prediction
Install Dependencies: Install the required Python dependencies using pip:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Dataset: Ensure that you have a dataset named jobs_in_data.csv containing the necessary columns for training the model (e.g., work_year and salary). You can use your own dataset or create one based on the provided template.
Run the Code: Run the Python script salary_prediction.py to train the model and make predictions:
Copy code
python salary_prediction.py
View Results: After running the script, you will see the predicted salaries for future years along with the mean absolute error on the test set.
Additional Notes
Feel free to modify the code or dataset to experiment with different features or algorithms.
Make sure to provide a valid dataset with appropriate columns for training the model.
Feel free to customize the README file further based on your specific requirements or additional instructions you want to provide.
